### Generative AI 
* [Stable Diffusion web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) - This is a repository for a browser interface based on Gradio library for Stable Diffusion
* [OpenVINO™ AI Plugins for GIMP](https://github.com/intel/openvino-ai-plugins-gimp) - Provides a set of OpenVINO based plugins that add AI features to GIMP (GNU IMAGE
MANIPULATION PROGRAM)

### AI Computer Vision
* [stable_diffusion.openvino](https://github.com/bes-dev/stable_diffusion.openvino) - This GitHub project provides an implementation of text-to-image generation using stable diffusion on Intel CPU or GPU. It requires Python 3.9.0 and is compatible with OpenVINO.
* [BMW-IntelOpenVINO-Detection-Inference-API](https://github.com/BMW-InnovationLab/BMW-IntelOpenVINO-Detection-Inference-API) - This is a repository for an object detection inference API using OpenVINO, supporting both Windows and Linux operating systems
* [yolov5_export_cpu](https://github.com/SamSamhuns/yolov5_export_cpu) - The project provides documentation on exporting YOLOv5 models for fast CPU inference using Intel's OpenVINO framework
* [LidarObjectDetection-PointPillars](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/AI-and-Analytics/End-to-end-Workloads/LidarObjectDetection-PointPillars) (C++ based, requires AI toolkit and OpenVINO). demonstrates how to perform 3D object detection and classification using input data (point cloud) from a LIDAR sensor.

  
### OpenVINO API extentions
* [OpenVINO™ C# API](https://github.com/guojin-yan/OpenVINO-CSharp-API) - C# API for OpenVINO

### Miscellaneous
* [Shared Memory for AI inference](https://github.com/aiblockly/aixbroad_code_example) - Shared memory interface between OpenVINO and CODESYS. It allows to exchange variable between Control Application, written in IEC and OpenVINO Application, which performs inference
* [webnn-native](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn-native)- WebNN Native is an implementation of the Web Neural Network API, providing building blocks, headers, and backends for ML platforms including DirectML, OpenVINO, and XNNPACK.

### Educational
